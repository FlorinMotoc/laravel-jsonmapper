# Laravel JSON Mapper
Map any JSON String on to your PHP Objects. Tested with Laravel, but basically working with every PHP Framework that 
supports namespaces. 

This Plugin is based on the project from [@cweiske](https://github.com/cweiske). I added support primary for the Laravel Framework
and I will also develope additional features, especially for the Laravel Framework.

__Via your terminal__ 
Paste the following line in your terminal and press enter. 

```
composer require davidhoeck/laravel-jsonmapper
